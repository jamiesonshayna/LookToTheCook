File Name: constants.dart
Version: 1.0

Description: This file holds our app-wide constants. Here we define colors, padding, height/width, etc.
that are applied to different widgets. Using this class makes the code less robust on view screens as there
is no need to write out color codes, long padding declarations, etc. (you can simply write the constant
name on the screen where you wish to use it. To use any of these constants, import this dart file on the page
where you would like to use it.
